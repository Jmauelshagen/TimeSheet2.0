        <h3>As a Supervisor, you are assigned the task of viewing your employee's timesheets and approving or denying them based on their edits to their time.</h3>
    </center>
    <br> <br>

    <h3>General Info</h3>
    <p>
        After a successful login as a Supervisor employee, you will reach a page with three choices: Reports, Approved TimeSheet, and Logout.
        The reports page will allow you to view an employee's time and approve or deny it based on its accuracy. The approved time page will allow you to view
        the timesheets that the supervisor has approved. The logout button will securely log you out of the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Reports</h3>
    <p>
        When in the reports page, use the two drop down tabs on the left of the page to select the employee you wish to view and the week ending date
        and click search. This will bring up that specific employee's timesheet for the week date selected. After careful consideration of the employee's time, you can
        choose to approve their time by clicking <b><i>Approve</i></b> or deny it by clicking <b><i>Deny</i></b>.

    <h3>Printing Timesheets</h3>
    <p>
        An Supervisor employee may be able to print an employee's timesheet via the print button in the overview page. A print window will then pop up
        prompting the user to print to the default printer.
